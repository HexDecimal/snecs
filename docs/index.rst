A straightforward, nimble ECS for Python.
=========================================

Installation
============

``snecs`` is hosted on PyPI_; you can install it the same way as any
PyPI_ package.
Depending on the dependency manager you're using for your project:

pip_:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install snecs

Pipenv_:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pipenv install snecs

Poetry_:

.. code-block:: console

   $ poetry add snecs

.. note::

    I highly recommend Poetry. It offers a very pleasant development
    experience, and makes it effortless to manage dependencies, and your
    entire project.

    Regardless of which tool you're using, I recommend installing ``snecs``
    and other Python packages in a `virtual environment`_. Poetry and Pipenv
    handle that for you!

This documentation is a tour of ``snecs``, structured into sections of
increasing technical detail.

- If you're not familiar with Entity-Component-Systems, the :ref:`ECS` page
  provides a quick explanation of the design pattern.
- When you're ready to start developing with ``snecs``, read
  :ref:`getting_started`. It's a high-level explanation of the library,
  detailing the general flow of working with it.
