A guided tour of snecs
======================

This section of the documentation is a tutorial introduction to ``snecs``.
It is intended to be a gentle walk through all the features of the library,
that should be useful whether you've never heard the term "ECS" before,
or already have a massive project running on esper_ or any other ECS framework.
